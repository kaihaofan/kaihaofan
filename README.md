I am a Master of Science in Analytics student at the University of Chicago. Currently I am focusing on learning at Online Controlled Experiments (A/B Testing), Explainable AI and Reinforcement Learning.  
  
üè´ I got my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree at University of Cincinnati. My full background and experience can be viewed at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaihaofan/)  
  
üå± My skillset consistently updating / improving with:  
   - **Programming & Database Languages**: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Bokeh*, statsmodels*, Scikit-Learn); R (TSA, fpp, MTS, RMarkdown); SQL (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL*); Neo4j (Cypher)  
   
   - **Statistics**: Regression (Linear & Logistic Regression, Generalized Linear Model), Hypothesis Testing, Probability  
   - **Machine Learning**: Dimension Reduction & Visualization (PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis, t-SNE, UMAP); Supervised Learning (SVM, Decision Trees, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost*, etc.); Unsupervised Learning (k-means, HDBSCAN); Time Series (sARIMA, ARIMAX, TBATs, prophet, Bayesian Structural Time Series/BSTS*)  
   - **Deep Learning**: (ANN, CNN, RNN, Keras, TensorFlow)
   - **Big Data**: Hadoop, Spark, GCP, AWS*  
   - **Business Intelligence**: Tableau
